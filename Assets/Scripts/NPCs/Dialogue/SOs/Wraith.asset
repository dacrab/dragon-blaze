  - "Ah, Pyroth, you\u2019ve stirred from your slumber. The world has grown colder,
    and the echoes of our kind have faded. The Ashen Plains await, where the whispers
    of ancient flames still linger. Seek their wisdom, young one."
  - Beware, for your awakening stirs more than just the Ashen Plains. A darkness
    grows in the north, a shadow that seeks to engulf the light. Nocturne, the Eclipse
    Dragon, watches and waits.
