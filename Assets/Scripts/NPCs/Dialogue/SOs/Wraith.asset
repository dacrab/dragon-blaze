  - Hail, Emberon, chosen of flame. Our world's harmony was shattered by the Shadow
    Wraith, a darkness that seeks to consume all. It unleashed a curse that dimmed
    the Guardians' light, trapping their essence in crystals scattered across the
    land.
  - Wanderer of flames, listen well, for our tale begins in tragedy. Long ago, our
    world was a tapestry of thriving lands, each guarded by a benevolent Guardian.
    Peace reigned until the Shadow Wraith emerged, seeking to corrupt the heart of
    our realm. It cast a spell, dark as night, and one by one, the Guardians fell,
    their essence trapped in crystals.
