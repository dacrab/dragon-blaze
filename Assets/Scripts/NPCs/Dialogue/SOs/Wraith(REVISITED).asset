  - The Ember Gem chose you, Pyroth. Its spectral glow mirrors your destiny. But
    remember, light attracts shadows. As you wield this power, tread carefully, for
    darkness seeks balance.
  - "With the Ember Gem\u2019s power, you are one step closer to confronting the
    darkness. Nocturne awaits, his power rooted in the very absence of light. Prepare
    well, for the final battle draws near."
