  paragraphs:
  - Welcome, Pyroth. I am Lucida, bearer of light. The Ember Gem awaits within the
    Cavern of Whispers. Its glow will guide you through the labyrinth. Trust in its
    brilliance, and you shall find your way.
  - "The light of the Ember Gem can pierce through many shadows, but one shadow looms
    larger than others. Nocturne\u2019s eclipse spreads far and wide, threatening
    to dim even the brightest flame."
