  - I am Lumina, keeper of the light. The darkness spread, and with each Guardian's
    fall, the lands they protected withered. The crystals that hold their powers
    are now lost in the five regions, guarded by the Wraith's minions. You must traverse
    treacherous paths, from the Whispering Forests to the Shattered Peaks, to find
    them.
